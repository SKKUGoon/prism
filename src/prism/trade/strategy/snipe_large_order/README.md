# Algorithmic Sniping of Large Orders

ðŸ”¹ Opportunity:
	â€¢	Why Upbit?
		â€¢	Upbit does not allow shorting, meaning large market buy orders cause rapid price jumps.
		â€¢	Retail traders place big orders without breaking them into smaller parts.
		â€¢	This creates sudden price spikes that bots can exploit instantly.
		â€¢	Because of KYC, most of the users of the upbit exchange are retail Koreans.

ðŸ”¹ Strategy:
	1.	Monitor the Upbit order book for unusually large orders.
	2.	Detect large buy orders before execution.
	3.	Buy just before the large order executes and sell into the spike.

ðŸ”¹ Advanced Implementation:
	1.	Real-Time Order Book Monitoring: Use Upbitâ€™s WebSocket API to track large orders in real time.
	2.	Predictive Execution: Detect order patterns to anticipate large trades before they happen.
	3.	Algorithmic Execution: Automate buying before the spike and selling instantly.

ðŸ”¹ Risk Mitigation:
	1.	Set a maximum profit target.
	2.	Use stop-losses to limit losses.
	3.	Monitor market conditions and adjust strategy parameters.
